# PoE Roller Blinds

![poe_roller_blinds](/units/roller_blinds/assets/cad_assembly.png "Assembly")

## Introduction

During my smart home development I was searching for smart PoE-powered black-out roller blinds and to my surprise I was not able to find anything remotely affordable and compatible with my home assistant setup.

There are a few offerings in the industry but they have their own downsides:

## Electronics

The electronics assembly is based on M5Stack PoE ESP32 module:

![module_product](/units/roller_blinds/assets/poesp32_01.png "M5Stack PoE ESP32")
![module_schematic](/units/roller_blinds/assets/SCH_UNIT-PoESP32_sch_01.png "M5Stack PoE ESP32 schematic")

When opened it will contain 2 PCBs connected via 2x5 pin header. The PCB with the RJ45 port and ESP32 module will be used as the main board for this project, the other PCB will be dismantled for the PoE module.

The complete assembly could be done with a perforated soldering board and a few wires, but since we do things proper-ish around here - the printed circuit board was designed:

![board_view](/units/roller_blinds/assets/poe_roller_blind_controller_pcb.png "Board view")

![3d_bottom](/units/roller_blinds/assets/roller_blind_controller_3d_bottom.png "3D bottom view")

## Motor preparation

The 28BYJ-48 unipolar motor is designed to be controlled with simpler logic, for example shift registers and contains the center taps of both of the coils connected to the 5th pin in the connector:

![coils_and_pins](/units/roller_blinds/assets/28BYJ-48-stepper-motor-coils.jpg "Coil and cable pin connections")

This makes the motor unusable with regular bipolar motor drivers like TMC2209. Luckily there is a simple modification to convert 28BYJ-48 to bipolar operation.

### The modification

You will need to take off the blue plastic cover from the side of the motor to reveal a small PCB with all the electrical connections of the motor. Then cut the center trace. I have done it with a rotary tool, but a sharp knife would work nicely too.

### Before

![unmodified_motor](/units/roller_blinds/assets/unmodified_28BYJ-48.jpg "Unmodified 28BYJ-48")

### After

![modified_motor](/units/roller_blinds/assets/modified_28BYJ-48.jpg "Modified 28BYJ-48")

Now the motor will work with any common stepper motor driver.

## Driver

The 28BYJ-48 motor is designed to take full 5V current on half of its coil. After the modification we technically doubled the coil resistance and can crank the TMC2209 driver current all the way up with the on-board potentiometer. I used FYSETC TMC2209 V4.0 driver boards so for me the potentiometer should be turned all the way clockwise.

If you are using any other TMC2209 driver - double check the RX, TX, INDEX, and DIAG pin positions, they differ from driver to driver and you may need to creatively add 1k resistor between RX and TX pins on the board. Also some of the boards have VREF, DIAG, and INDEX pins switched around. PCB only supports driver boards which have INDEX and DIAG pins at 90 degrees from the other pins.
