# turbomansion

Hello, welcome to the turbomansion repository.

## The name

First let's start with the name - turbomansion.
The word comes from a few places in pop culture history but for me it got stuck in my head because of the legendary looter-shooter video game series - Borderlands, made by 2K and Gearbox. "Turbomansion" is mentioned in Borderlands The Pre-Sequel during mission "Lost Legion Invasion" as seen in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qd0URBWsjE).

## The idea

Main goal of this project is to create a fully open source smart home units library. Of course nothing is perfect and so is this project, some things may deviate from the ultimate goal and some compromises will be made but I will be happy and I hope anyone who reads this would feel the same if the project does not deviate too far from these values:

* Open source documentation, plans, files, code, etc.
* Easily obtainable materials all over the world
* Low cost and low effort
* Ease of deployment
* Ease of use
* Ease of maintenance and repair
* Customizability
* No proprietary bullshit
* No manufacturer cloud connectivity (unless you want to (trust me - you don't))
* Complete control with Home Assistant
